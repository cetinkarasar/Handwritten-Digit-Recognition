This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to recognize **handwritten digits**.  
It features a Streamlit-based web interface that allows users to test their own handwritten digits.

---

## 📌 Features
✅ **Machine Learning:** Recognizes handwritten digits using a CNN model.  
✅ **Web Interface:** User-friendly and easy-to-test Streamlit interface.  
✅ **Model Training:** You can train a new model or use the pre-trained one.  
✅ **Image Processing:** Converts uploaded images into 28x28 format for accurate recognition.
